## Inspirations/copying

 - Inspiration: osu!lazer, Windows 11, Material Design 3, AvdanOS (concept)
 - Copying: The license allows you to. Personally I have absolutely no problem with others redistributing/recreating my work. There's no "stealing" (unless you do weird stuff and violate the license). (this note is here because some people actually asked)
